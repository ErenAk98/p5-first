Cruel was the day to come so early
Crueler was my disposition
I had just realized what i was
Inside the coffin they buried me in
But first, how the hell do i shave


Pity to those who tried to challenge
The relentless and tiring climb 
A game of wits and might
A ruin and fight they call life


Closer still our hands together
Sharing the comfort of company
The warmth the sincerity
A veil against the trying cold


Crones talk of old magics
Foul, fickle fanatics
Damn them all to hell
I have no use for semantics


Cracking steps of bone
A trail of blood and stone
I left a troubling sight
For those who travel alone


Children ought to learn power
The strength of a looming tower
The worth of a hundred swords
Or a constant deadly arrow shower


Cruel gesture smiling is
A sight so sweet yet so sore
Promising the unknown
Trails of a lovely shore


Constipated, sullen, stuck
I feel im out of luck
A crude way to justify 
That im out for a fuck


Pale light shone upon
Sheets with dirty spots
Mistakes in remembrance
Will keep me up at night


A brandished song comes into mind
Figures of a dance forgotten
Silent obedience under the scorn
Marked by the master of the whip


Pitch black night, a reminisence of color
Blackness fades, a purple takes place
The hues of a morning arival
Orange and red comes jolly and sudden
A fateful dawn creeps serene


Converse with me, sing and dance
Reeling and dreaming in your trance
I no longer search for earthly rubbish
More i yearn for heavensent sense


That old crone keeps singing the old
Very old hymn i tap and tap i keep
It goes "o bold ye keep acting bold
Sing you sing with stories i told" i weep

A clear head and safe slumber
Makes my mind go free of fright
Over the hills through the lumber
I glide growing colder, number


Old place new faces all around
Come, spare me a round or two
I glance on the faces foreign and sound
I wish i could round the clock an hour or two
