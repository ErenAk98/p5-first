(not certain) The Undead

Im an honest man, hand to god
I truly am, believe me
When they asked me if i murdered my wife
And hacked her to pieces
I said yes of course
Yes i did your honor
But i hacked her to pieces
Only because she started screaming
Weeks after i slit her throat



She awoke, then she rose, my love rose
Choking foul, whispered cruel and she froze
Because ı've, laid roses, on her grave
I begged full, broke the rule, so we save
